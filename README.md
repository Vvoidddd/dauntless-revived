# Dauntless Revived

**Dauntless Revived is a private-server revival of Dauntless**, Phoenix Labs' free-to-play co-op
monster-hunting game. The official servers shut down on **30 May 2025**. This project lets you play
the genuine **Dauntless 1.4.4** client (October 2020, Unreal Engine 4) again, on a server you host
yourself. It is a modified fork of **[Undaunted](https://github.com/SyST3MDeV/Undaunted) by gwog
(Gregory Morford) and contributors**, who built the parts that make this possible: the DLL that
turns the retail client into a game server, the deploy server, the metagame backend and the
launcher. This fork adds fixes, saved progression, server-side parties, a friend launcher built on
Undaunted's, a server kit for rented Windows machines and documentation. No game files are
distributed in this repository or on the docs site: you need your own copy of the 1.4.4 client.

> **This is not a public server.** It is run for a few friends. Anyone can host their own copy from
> this repository.

## Quick answers

### Can you still play Dauntless?
Not on the official servers: Phoenix Labs shut them down on 30 May 2025. If you have a copy of the
1.4.4 client, you can play it on your own server with this project.

### Is there a Dauntless private server?
Yes, this is one: a self-hosted server for the 1.4.4 client, based on Undaunted. It is not open to
the public, so you run your own and invite your friends.

### Can I join your server?
No. Our server runs on a rented machine, but only people the owner invites can make an account. The
[setup guide](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/) explains how to host your own.

### Does this project give out the game?
No. Neither this repository nor the docs site contains or links to game files. You need your own
copy of the client.

### Which version of the game does it work with?
Only **1.4.4**. The final client, 2.1.1, does not work, because Undaunted's server DLL hooks fixed
addresses inside the 1.4.4 executable.

### Do I need an Epic Games account?
No. Each player logs in with a personal account key issued by your own server.

### Is it official?
No. It is an unofficial, non-commercial fan project, not affiliated with Phoenix Labs or Epic Games.

More answers are in the [FAQ](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/faq.html).

## Status

As of 22 September 2026. The game itself has so far been played by one person, the owner: first on
the host PC, then on 22 September 2026 over the internet on our rented server, through the launcher.
The rows marked "(solo)" mean exactly that. A test with a second player is next.

| Feature | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Log in with a personal account key | Works | No Epic account needed |
| Tutorial | Works | Started on demand by the deploy server |
| Ramsgate (the hub city) | Works (solo) | A permanent Ramsgate server runs next to the backend |
| Training Dojo | Works | Starts the first time someone goes there |
| Hunts | Works (solo) | Played: a Lesser Boreus hunt and a pursuit on the host PC, and the new-player pursuit over the internet on the rented server |
| Crafting | Works | |
| Inventory, gear and quests | Works (solo) | Saved to SQLite; survives a client restart and a full server restart |
| Slayer level, mastery and the Hunt Pass | Works (solo), on by default | Start from the beginning (Slayer level 1, no mastery, an empty Hunt Pass) and are saved; every account owns the Elite Hunt Pass. Tested in game on a throwaway account, including a full restart. On the rented server on 22 September 2026: Slayer level 3, weapon mastery and behemoth mastery (rank 2, the first time behemoth mastery was seen in game), with the rank rewards confirmed by the game server. `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` brings back upstream's fixed level 50 ([upgrade notes](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/upgrading.html)) |
| A server on a rented machine | Running | The [Windows server kit](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/windows-server.html) was deployed to a rented Windows Server 2019 VPS in public mode on 21–22 September 2026. Checked there: the stack starts at boot as the service account, Ramsgate runs and sends heartbeats, the gateway answers from the internet with the pinned certificate, and the hourly backup runs. In the first real test (22 September 2026) three game servers ran at once, and the UDP allowlist opened the game ports for the player and closed them after they left |
| Friend launcher | Released | The first release, 0.1.0, was published on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mixutin/dauntless-revived/releases/latest) by CI, with `SHA256SUMS.txt` and a build provenance attestation; installed launchers update themselves. The owner registered with it on the rented server and downloaded the game (about 11 GB) through the gateway. 0.1.1, published the same night, stopped turning off the game's automatic exposure, which had made Ramsgate far too dark. Not code-signed yet: on the owner's PC SmartScreen blocked the installer outright, and checking it against `SHA256SUMS.txt` and unblocking it worked ([how](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/friends.html)) |
| Playing with friends over the internet | Works (two players) | Tested on 22 September 2026 on the rented server. First one player: an invite, registration, the game download, the tutorial, Ramsgate, the Training Dojo and the first hunt. Then two players together: they saw each other in Ramsgate and hunted together, after queueing the same hunt within a few seconds of each other (parties don't work in game yet, see the next row) |
| Parties and the friends list | Built, blocked in game (fix pending) | Server side: party invites, accept and decline, promote, kick and leave, the whole party on one hunt server, back to Ramsgate together, lookups by name, and a friends list and blocklist saved in SQLite. Passes the integration tests with simulated players. In the two-player test on 22 September 2026 the friend search and party invites stopped at `POST /account/mapping`; a corrected reply, and a fix for a hunt that waited for the same player twice, are ready but not deployed yet. Invites don't require being friends. Showing friends as online needs the chat server, which is not built |
| Backups | Works on our hosts | Hourly, plus one around every server start and stop. The Windows server kit has its own backup task (running on the rented server). The scripts of our original host PC, where a restore was tested, are not in this repository ([do-it-yourself version](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/admin.html#back-up-the-database)) |
| Friend kit | Built | The Tailscale-only fallback: hash-checked setup and play scripts. Not used by a friend yet |
| Bounties | Not yet | Stored with real progression; drafting and claiming not yet tried in game |
| Text chat | Not yet | Not built. Designed: a small XMPP server. Use Discord meanwhile |
| Multiple loadouts | Not yet | Slot unlocks stored with real progression; the extra slots not yet tried in game |

The live checklist, with every step and what "done" means for it, is [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## How it works

1. Each player runs the unmodified 1.4.4 client with two DLLs from Undaunted next to it; they point the game's backend calls at your server.
2. The **metagame** (TypeScript, Express, SQLite; TCP 61000) handles accounts, characters, inventory, loadouts, progression, matchmaking, parties and the friends list.
3. The **deploy server** (TCP 61001, this machine only) starts game servers on demand: more copies of the same client, switched into server mode by the DLL.
4. Those game servers (UDP 8770 to 8777: Ramsgate on 8777, the Training Dojo on 8776, up to 6 hunts on 8770 to 8775) host the game itself.
5. Friends connect in one of two ways. In **private mode** they reach the host over Tailscale. In **public mode** (the default of the [Windows server kit](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/windows-server.html)) a TLS **gateway** is the game's only public TCP port: the friend launcher checks its certificate against the fingerprint in the invite, and the game's UDP ports open only for the addresses of players who logged in. A **content server** behind it hands the game files to registered accounts, and the launcher checks every file against a list built into it.

## Repository layout

The component folders keep upstream's `Undaunted...` names for now (renaming them is roadmap item
4.15); the npm packages in them are named `dauntless-revived-*`.

| Folder | What it is |
|---|---|
| `UndauntedMetagame/` | The backend the game talks to: accounts, characters, inventory, loadouts, progression, matchmaking, parties, the friends list and the `/undaunted/api` admin API |
| `UndauntedDeployServer/` | Starts and supervises game-server processes (Ramsgate, hunts, the Training Dojo) |
| `UndauntedGateway/` | Public mode only: the TLS gateway (the game's one public TCP port) and the helper that opens the game ports for logged-in players |
| `UndauntedContent/` | The content server: the game files (checked against a manifest of 410 files), news and the art pack, for registered launchers only |
| `UndauntedLauncher/` | The Dauntless Revived Launcher: the Windows app for invited friends, based on Undaunted's launcher. `assets/` holds the two pinned prebuilt DLLs every setup installs |
| `UndauntedInternalServer/` | The C++ source of Undaunted's server DLL, which lets the retail client run as a game server and points clients at the backend. Nothing in this repository builds it; every setup uses the prebuilt DLLs from `UndauntedLauncher/assets/` |
| `deploy/windows-server/` | The Windows server kit: installs and runs the whole server on Windows Server 2019, in public or private mode, with backups, invites and updates |
| `friend-kit/` | The Tailscale-only setup and play scripts for invited friends' PCs |
| `tools/` | `sync-roadmap.js` and `build-llms.js` (the generated docs files), `make-friend-kit.ps1`, `make-game-manifest.js`, and in `ci/` the checks CI runs |
| `docs/` | The documentation site (GitHub Pages), with the Finnish pages in `docs/fi/` |
| `.github/` | The CI workflows (`ci.yml`, `launcher-release.yml`), Dependabot, and the issue and pull request templates |
| `ROADMAP.md` | The plan and live checklist |

## Changes from upstream

- The metagame and deploy server listen on this machine only unless told otherwise (`BIND_HOST`).
  Upstream listened on every network interface, and the deploy server has no authentication.
- Failing to bind a port is now a hard error. Upstream reported success anyway and exited silently.
- Every request the metagame receives is logged, marking calls made by game servers.
- The Training Dojo starts the first time someone goes there instead of at boot (`ENABLE_DOJO=1`
  restores the old behaviour).
- Tokens are removed from the request log. An optional capture of request bodies for the save
  routes that are not finished yet (`LOG_BODIES=1`) records what the game sends, capped at 8 KB per
  request (64 KB for `/inventory`) and with tokens removed. The Windows server kit keeps it off in
  public mode.
- **Safer saves.** Character saves are transactional and refuse a stale version (409). An inventory
  transaction that arrives twice is applied once, and every item change goes into an append-only
  log. Character and loadout history can be rolled back from the admin API. Upstream also never
  reported removed stacks after a transaction, so spent Rams and materials stayed on screen and a
  second upgrade went through for free; that is fixed.
- **Usernames and invites.** Names of 3 to 16 letters, digits and underscores, unique regardless of
  case, checked together with the invite code; the admin can rename a player.
- **A permission check on every route.** Players can only read and write their own account and
  characters; game-server routes need the game-server key and a direct local connection.
- **Parties and the friends list** (server side, not yet tried with two real game clients): invites,
  promote, kick and leave, the whole party on one hunt server and back to Ramsgate together, lookups
  by name, and a friends list and blocklist saved in SQLite.
- **Live server status for the launcher.** The list of players online and running hunts is shown to
  registered players only. `/dauntless-status` gives the server's name, version, source URL and
  commit (for the AGPL), and no player count.
- **Real progression by default.** Upstream answered progression with a fixed template (every
  account at level 50, a Hunt Pass with nothing to claim, and most likely the Elite track locked) and saved
  nothing. Our metagame stores Slayer level, mastery, the Hunt Pass, entitlements (the Elite pass
  for everyone), loadout slots, cooldowns and bounties per account. `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` restores
  upstream's behaviour. Updating a server that already has players? Read the
  [upgrade notes](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/upgrading.html) first.
- A **friend kit** (`friend-kit/`, packaged by `tools/make-friend-kit.ps1`): a one-time setup and a
  launcher for invited players. It checks the two Undaunted DLLs against pinned SHA-256 hashes,
  registers the player, points the game's chat connection at the host so it never contacts Epic's
  old chat server, and ships with the license, third-party notices and a `SOURCE.txt` naming the
  exact commit.
- Our own **friend launcher** (`UndauntedLauncher/`), built on upstream's, which was hard-wired to
  Undaunted's own servers. It joins a server from an invite, registers the player (it keeps the key
  only encrypted with Windows DPAPI; the one plain copy is a backup the player chooses to save),
  downloads the game from the host and checks every file against a manifest
  built into it, installs the two pinned DLLs and the game settings, and in public mode relays the
  game's plain-HTTP calls over TLS pinned to the invite's certificate. CI publishes each new version on GitHub Releases, and installed launchers
  update themselves.
- A **content server** (`UndauntedContent/`) that hands the game files only to registered accounts,
  with resumable downloads, and a **gateway** (`UndauntedGateway/`) for public mode: the game's only
  public TCP port, TLS with a pinned self-signed certificate, admin routes and the game-server key refused
  from outside, body limits and rate limits, and a helper that opens the game's UDP ports only for
  the addresses of players who logged in.
- A **Windows server kit** (`deploy/windows-server/`): one command from your PC installs the whole
  server on a Windows Server 2019 machine over key-only SSH, with a low-privilege service account,
  start at boot, supervision, hourly backups, invites and updates.
- Hunt servers start with their console window hidden.
- **CI** on every push: the builds and tests of every package, the server kit's tests, the docs
  build, and a check that no secrets, keys, databases or game files are committed.
- **Our own name.** The launcher, the in-game welcome text and the server's messages say Dauntless
  Revived, and the credits name Undaunted. The folders, the server DLL's file name
  (`UndauntedInternalServer.dll`), the `/undaunted/api` routes and the `x-undaunted-*` headers keep
  the Undaunted names for now (roadmap item 4.15).
- A **documentation site** in `docs/`, published at
  [mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/), in English
  and Finnish: setup guides, a reference of every setting, port, route and file, findings about the
  game's backend, and the roadmap.

Backups: the Windows server kit takes them itself (hourly, and around every start and stop), each
database copy checked with `PRAGMA integrity_check`. Our original host PC runs its own backup scripts
(roadmap item 0.1), which are not part of this repository. The metagame itself takes no backup, so if
you host by hand, set one up yourself:
[Run it for a group](https://mixutin.github.io/dauntless-revived/setup/admin.html#back-up-the-database)
has a do-it-yourself version.

## Security

- The metagame and the deploy server bind to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- The deploy server has **no authentication by design**. Never expose it beyond the host machine.
- Friends connect either over Tailscale (private mode) or through the gateway (public mode). The 1.4.4
  client itself speaks plain HTTP, so in public mode it only ever talks to the launcher on the
  player's own PC, which forwards over TLS pinned to the server's certificate. Of the server's game
  services, only the gateway's TCP port is open to everyone; the game's UDP ports open only for
  players who logged in.
