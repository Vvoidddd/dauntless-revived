## Text chat {#chat}

**September 2026.** Applies to every server updated to the version with text chat (the kit then has
`Set-Chat.ps1`, and `Stack.ps1 status` has a `chat` line).

### What changes {#chat-what-changes}

- **Nothing for players until you switch chat on.** Chat is a listener inside the metagame, off by
  default: the kit writes `CHAT=0` unless you choose `-Chat On`. While it is off, the game's chat
  connection gets 502 from the gateway and retries every 15-45 s, harmlessly, as before.
- **`Set-Chat.ps1` arrives with the update.** Switch chat on afterwards, in a second run when nobody
  is playing (it restarts the stack): `Deploy-Remote.ps1 -Server <address> -Chat On` from your PC, or
  `Set-Chat.ps1 -On` on the server ([Windows server kit]({{ winserver_page.url | relative_url }}#chat)).
  `-Chat` cannot go with `-Update`.
- **The gateway gives the game's chat connections a rate bucket of their own** (`GATEWAY_RATE_WS`,
  default `20,12`: 20 at once, then 12 per minute per address), so chat reconnects never use up the
  budget a player's game traffic needs ([Configuration]({{ config_page.url | relative_url }}#gateway)).
- **No database migration, no firewall rule and no new launcher.** Every launcher from v0.1.0 on
  relays chat; v0.1.5 has the updated credits.

### What your players will see {#chat-what-players-see}

With chat on: Ramsgate and hunt chat, party chat, guild chat and whispers, all with usernames. Ramsgate
chat is per session for now, so two players share it only when they travelled to Ramsgate together as
a party. A game that was already running when chat went on connects within about 45 s. Online status
(friends showing as online) is still to come.

### What you can do {#chat-what-you-can-do}

- The first time, run the two-player test under
  [Text chat]({{ chat_page.url | relative_url }}#how-to-verify), which lists the log lines to expect.
- If real players are refused room joins with `reason=nick-resource`, `nick-format` or `nick-name`, set
  `CHAT_NICK_CHECK=log` in `metagame.env` and restart when nobody is playing. For anything serious,
  `Set-Chat.ps1 -Off`.
- **Going back** to the build before the update (`Update-DauntlessServer.ps1 -Rollback`) needs
  nothing else: the older code ignores `CHAT` and `GATEWAY_RATE_WS`.

## Friends, parties and guilds {#social}

**September 2026.** Applies to every server updated to the version with guilds (the metagame's log
shows `guild:` lines, and `GET /guild/invite/player` no longer logs "Guild invites (stubbed)").

### What changes {#social-what-changes}

- **A new migration, `0013_guilds`, runs by itself at the first start.** It only adds three tables
  (`guilds`, `guildmembers`, `guildinvites`); no existing table or row is changed. Back the database
  up first as for any update ([Back up the database]({{ admin_page.url | relative_url }}#back-up-the-database)).
  The previous version still starts on a database that has `0013` (it runs no migration it does not
  know and ignores the new tables), so going back needs no restore.
- **Three replies on the login path change.** Every player's client calls them at each login:
  `POST /accountinfo/public` now describes the account that was asked about (and answers 404 for an
  unknown one), `POST /account/mapping` now maps ids in the shape the client reads, and
  `GET /guild/invite/player` has a new envelope (`{"code": "OK", "message": "", "payload": {"invites":
  []}, "invites": []}` instead of the old stub). The tests replay the client's parsing, but none of
  this has been seen in a real game yet.
- **Guilds can be created and joined.** A guild is created only when the leader typed and validated
  that exact name in the create window; staff and project words are reserved.
- **Invites are stricter:** a block removes the pending invites between two players, a declined party
  invite pauses that sender for 2 minutes and a declined guild invite pauses that guild for 24 hours,
  and a player sends at most 20 party invites in 10 minutes.

### What your players will see {#social-what-players-see}

**Every player must restart the game once after the update.** The client keeps the first account
info and the first mapping it got for each player for the whole session, so the old, wrong answers
stay until the game restarts. After that: party invites appear under PARTY INVITES, Add Friends
works (the other player sees the request at their next login), and the Guilds tab can create and
join guilds. Online status and EPIC FRIENDS still do not work. Chat came with a later update
([Text chat](#chat)).
[Join as a friend]({{ friends_page.url | relative_url }}#friends-parties-and-guilds) explains it to
players.

### What you can do {#social-what-you-can-do}

- For the first session after the update, watch the metagame's log for the lines listed on
  [Friends, parties and guilds]({{ social_page.url | relative_url }}#how-to-verify). `LOG_BODIES=1`
  also records the request bodies (account ids and guild names); the server kit forces it off in
  public mode, so set it by hand for that session only and delete the body log afterwards.
- If logins misbehave after the update, each change has a switch in the metagame's settings (restart
  the metagame after changing it, and the players restart the game):

  | Symptom | Switch | What it puts back |
  |:--------|:-------|:------------------|
  | Login or the Social panel breaks, other players' names are wrong | `ACCOUNTINFO_PUBLIC_LEGACY=1` | Upstream's account info reply (party invites stop showing again) |
  | Login breaks right after the account lookups | `ACCOUNT_MAPPING=0` | No mappings (Add Friends does nothing again) |
  | Login or world loads break around the guild calls | `GUILDS=0` | The old guild stubs; stored guilds are kept and come back with the switch |
  | Invite to Party does nothing for a player on their own | `PARTY_SOLO_STUB=0` | Nothing to undo: a plain reply for a party of one |
  | Creating a guild always says "Unable to create guild." and the log says "no validate of this name" | `GUILD_CREATE_ACTIVITY_FALLBACK=1` | The weaker check (see [Configuration]({{ config_page.url | relative_url }}#metagame-social)) |

## Real progression is on by default {#real-progression-default}

**September 2026.** Applies to every server updated to a version where real progression is the
default, if the metagame's settings have no `PROGRESSION_MODE` line, an empty one, or a value other
than `real` or `stub`. You can tell the new version by its startup line, which begins
`Progression mode: real for every account`. Values such as `off`, `0` or `false` used to mean the
stub and now mean real. If you only set `PROGRESSION_REAL_ACCOUNTS` to try real progression on
chosen accounts, every other account now switches too: add `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` to keep that
split.

### What changed

Before, the metagame answered every progression request with upstream Undaunted's stub unless
`PROGRESSION_MODE=real` was set:

- every account showed Slayer level 50 and maxed mastery, and nothing a player earned was stored;
- the Hunt Pass reported 99,999,999 with every reward already claimed, and the stub lists no
  entitlements, so the Elite track most likely showed as locked;
- the "Claim your Hunt Pass rewards" tutorial quest could never complete.

Now **an unset or empty `PROGRESSION_MODE` means real progression for every account**:

- Slayer level, weapon and behemoth mastery and their objectives start from the beginning
  (Slayer level 1, no mastery) and are saved from hunts and quests.
- The Hunt Pass (season 9b) starts empty. Claims on the free and the Elite track are saved. Every
  account owns the Elite pass by default (the `ENTITLEMENTS_DEFAULT` list).
- Rank rewards are granted once, by the game server, through the inventory. The metagame only
  records the claim.
- Entitlements, loadout slots, cooldowns and bounties are stored per account in the same mode.

`PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` still gives upstream's behaviour, and `PROGRESSION_REAL_ACCOUNTS` still
lists accounts that get real progression in stub mode (outside stub mode it is ignored). Any other
value is logged as a warning and treated as real; before this change it meant the stub.

**What has been tested.** A tester played in real mode on a throwaway account, then restarted
everything and logged in again ([roadmap]({{ roadmap_page.url | relative_url }}) items 2.8 to 2.12,
2.14 and 2.15): levels from 1, Slayer and weapon (axe) mastery rank-ups confirmed with each reward
granted once, no endless mastery pop-up, Hunt Pass claims on the free and the Elite track, an
entitlement granted by the game server, and all of it still there after the restart. **Not tried
yet:** behemoth mastery (it uses the same storage as weapon mastery), the extra loadout slots in the
UI, drafting and claiming bounties in the UI, cooldowns across a daily reset, several players at
once, and moving an account that already played under the stub's fake level 50 down to level 1
(roadmap item 2.13). With several players, note that a player's own client now gets 403 when it
asks for another account's progression, where the stub answered with the asking player's own data.
Escalation is still upstream's stub in both modes.

### What your players will see

**Nothing is migrated automatically.** A player who played on your server before the update has no
stored progression, so they start at **Slayer level 1 with an empty Hunt Pass**, like a new player.

- Their items should stay, including anything the fake level 50 handed out (alternate weapons,
  weapon unlock tokens). The update does not touch the inventory, but this has not been tried in game
  yet.
- Level 1 locks again what the fake 50 unlocked: consumable slots (ranks 2, 4 and 7), some crafting,
  and the hunts gated on Slayer level. Extra loadout slots never worked on the stub (it reports one
  slot); with real progression they come with ranks 34, 38 and 45 (not tried in the UI yet).
- Daily and weekly limits (cooldowns) now carry over between hunts and restarts. The stub forgot them
  each time a server loaded the player. If a limit never clears, `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` is the
  fallback while you report it.

At startup the metagame logs its mode and, while such players exist, a warning with their count:

```
Progression mode: real for every account (the default)
3 player account(s) have no stored progression yet: they start at Slayer level 1 with an empty Hunt Pass, not upstream's fake max ranks. Nothing was migrated. ...
```

The count is of accounts that own a character but have no stored progression. An admin account that
never played is not counted, and a player drops out of the count once they earn anything or you
seed them. On a new server the count also includes players who have just created a character and
not earned any XP yet. For them the warning is harmless, and it goes away once they earn their first
XP.

### Choose what happens, before your players log in

| You want | Do this |
|:---------|:--------|
| Everyone starts fresh (what we chose for our own server) | Nothing. Tell your players that levels and the Hunt Pass start over and are kept from now on. |
| One player keeps max ranks | Seed them with `grandfather` while they are offline (below). Every track is set to its maximum rank and confirmed there, so nothing is granted and nothing pops up. Their Hunt Pass reads fully claimed. |
| Keep the old stub for now | Add `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` to the metagame's settings and restart the metagame. `PROGRESSION_REAL_ACCOUNTS=<id>,<id>` gives chosen accounts real progression meanwhile. |

A `fresh` seed sets every track to 0 and clears the stored objectives. A player with no stored
progression is already at 0, so you only need `fresh` to reset an account that has real
progression already, such as a test account. The seed changes only that account's progression rows
and records the change in the `progression_events` table. The `grandfather` seed is covered by unit
tests but has not been tried in game yet.

**Take a backup first.** The metagame runs its database migrations at startup. The server kit backs
up around every update; on a hand-built host, see
[Back up the database]({{ admin_page.url | relative_url }}#back-up-the-database).

### Where the setting lives

- **Hand-built host** ([Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }})): `.env` in the
  `UndauntedMetagame` folder. Restart the metagame after a change.
- **Windows server kit** ([Windows server kit]({{ winserver_page.url | relative_url }})):
  `C:\DauntlessRevived\data\config\metagame.env`. The installer and `Update-DauntlessServer.ps1` keep
  every setting already in that file (the installer rewrites only the keys that describe the host,
  and neither keeps comment lines), so a server that already had `PROGRESSION_MODE=real` or `stub`
  keeps it. To stay on the stub, add the line **before** you update, or add it afterwards and run
  `C:\DauntlessRevived\bin\Stack.ps1 restart -Only metagame`. Unless the file says `real` or `stub`,
  the updater repeats the metagame's warning about players without stored progression after a
  successful update.
- **Restores and rollbacks follow the same rule.** A restore from a backup taken before this change,
  or a rollback to a build from before it (the updater's automatic rollback, or
  `Update-DauntlessServer.ps1 -Rollback`), uses the settings as they are. With no line, an older
  build means the stub again (players see the fake level 50; their stored progression stays in the
  database), and a newer build means real. Set `PROGRESSION_MODE=real` or `stub` explicitly if you
  want the mode fixed across restores and rollbacks.

### Seeding a player

Admin routes are refused through the public gateway (or any other proxy), so run this on the server
itself, with an admin account key. Save it as `seed-progression.js` anywhere on that machine; it
needs Node 18 or newer and nothing else:

```js
// node seed-progression.js <admin key file> list
// node seed-progression.js <admin key file> <UserId> grandfather|fresh
// Optional: set METAGAME to the metagame's address if it does not listen on 127.0.0.1:61000.
const fs = require("fs");
const [keyFile, userId, mode] = process.argv.slice(2);
const base = (process.env.METAGAME || "http://127.0.0.1:61000") + "/undaunted/api";
const key = fs.readFileSync(keyFile, "utf8").trim();

async function call(method, path, body) {
  const r = await fetch(base + path, {
    method,
    headers: { "x-undaunted-user-api-key": key, ...(body ? { "content-type": "application/json" } : {}) },
    body: body ? JSON.stringify(body) : undefined,
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(15000),
  });
  if (!r.ok) throw new Error(`${method} ${path} returned HTTP ${r.status}`);
  return r.json();
}

(async () => {
  if (userId === "list") {
    const { Users } = await call("GET", "/GetAllUsers");
    for (const u of Users) {
      const p = await call("GET", "/Progression?UserId=" + encodeURIComponent(u.UserId));
      const slayer = p.Tracks.find((t) => t.progression_id === "MasteryTrack_PlayerLevel");
      const pass = p.Tracks.find((t) => t.progression_id === "season09b");
      console.log(`${u.UserId}  ${u.Username}  real=${p.RealMode}  slayer=${slayer.earned_free_rank}  huntpass=${pass.progress}`);
    }
    return;
  }
  if (!userId || (mode !== "grandfather" && mode !== "fresh")) throw new Error("usage: see the first lines of this file");
  const r = await call("POST", "/SeedProgression", { UserId: userId, Mode: mode });
  console.log(`${r.UserId}: seeded ${r.Mode}, ${r.Tracks.length} tracks, real mode ${r.RealMode}`);
})().catch((e) => { console.error(e.message); process.exit(1); });
```

**Hand-built host.** The admin key file is `C:\dr\data\owner.key` if you followed
[Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}). If you followed
[Run it for a group]({{ admin_page.url | relative_url }}), the metagame listens on your Tailscale
address instead of `127.0.0.1`, so set `METAGAME` first:

```powershell
$env:METAGAME = "http://100.x.y.z:61000"   # the metagame's BIND_HOST
node seed-progression.js C:\dr\data\owner.key list
```

**Kit server.** Run it in an elevated PowerShell (Run as administrator): `owner.key` is readable only
by Administrators. In private mode the kit's metagame listens on the server's Tailscale address;
these lines read the address and port from the kit's configuration and work in both modes:

```powershell
$cfg = Get-Content C:\DauntlessRevived\data\config\server.json -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
$port = if ($cfg.Ports.metagame) { $cfg.Ports.metagame } else { 61000 }
$env:METAGAME = "http://$($cfg.BindAddress):$port"
node seed-progression.js C:\DauntlessRevived\data\keys\owner.key list
node seed-progression.js C:\DauntlessRevived\data\keys\owner.key UID-... grandfather
```

`list` prints every account with its Slayer level as the game will show it and its Hunt Pass XP. It
answers `real=false` for accounts that are still on the stub (with `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub`); a seed
is stored either way and used once the account is in real mode. The script never prints the key.
