# Configuration
{: .no_toc }

Every server component of Dauntless Revived is configured with environment variables. None of them
has a configuration file format of its own: on a development PC each one reads a `.env` file in its
folder, and on a server installed with the Windows server kit each one reads its own file in
`C:\DauntlessRevived\data\config\`. This page lists every variable each component reads, what an
unset value means, who normally sets it, and which ones are secret.

It is a reference. For a working setup step by step, follow [Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }})
(one PC), [Run it for a group]({{ admin_page.url | relative_url }}) (Tailscale) or the
[Windows server kit]({{ winserver_page.url | relative_url }}) (a rented server). Port numbers are on
[Ports and network]({{ ports_page.url | relative_url }}), the game's own ini files and command lines on
[Game settings]({{ gamesettings_page.url | relative_url }}), and script parameters on
[Scripts and parameters]({{ scripts_page.url | relative_url }}).

**Secrets.** Rows marked **Secret** hold values that let someone sign in as any player, act as a
game server or talk to the firewall helper. Never share them, never commit them, and never paste or
print them. The examples on this page are placeholders.

## How settings are loaded {#how-settings-are-loaded}

| Component | Folder | Started with | Developer file | File on a kit server |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------|:---------------|:---------------------|
| Metagame | `UndauntedMetagame/` | `npm start` = `node --env-file=.env dist/server.js`; `npm run dev` = `tsx watch --env-file=.env src/server.ts` | `UndauntedMetagame/.env` (must exist, or Node refuses to start) | `data\config\metagame.env` |
| Deploy server | `UndauntedDeployServer/` | `npm start` = `node --env-file=.env dist/server.js`; `npm run dev` = `tsx --env-file=.env src/server.ts` | `UndauntedDeployServer/.env` (must exist) | `data\config\deployserver.env` |
| Gateway | `UndauntedGateway/` | `npm start` = `node --env-file-if-exists=.env dist/server.js` | `UndauntedGateway/.env` (optional) | `data\config\gateway.env` (public mode only) |
| Allowlist helper | `UndauntedGateway/` | `npm run start:allowlist` = `node --env-file-if-exists=.env dist/allowlist/server.js` | the same `UndauntedGateway/.env` | `data\config\allowlist.env` (public mode only) |
| Content server | `UndauntedContent/` | `npm start` = `node --env-file-if-exists=.env dist/server.js` (also `npm run verify`) | `UndauntedContent/.env` (optional) | `data\config\content.env` (when the content server is installed) |
| Launcher | `UndauntedLauncher/` | the installed app, or `npm start` | none: it reads its own process environment only | not on the server |

Rules that apply to all of them:

- **The shell wins over the file.** Node's `--env-file` never replaces a variable that is already
  set in the environment. A `PORT` or `NODE_ENV` left in your PowerShell session (`$env:PORT`)
  silently overrides the `.env` value. Check with `Get-ChildItem Env:` and remove one with
  `Remove-Item Env:PORT`. `npm run db:generate` in the metagame reads `.env` through `dotenv`, which
  behaves the same way.
- **The kit makes the file win.** `Stack.ps1` starts each component as
  `node --env-file=<root>\data\config\<file>.env <script>`, with the component's folder under
  `<root>\app\` as the working directory. Before that it clears every variable the file names from its
  own process, so nothing inherited can override the file.
- **The working directory matters.** Relative paths (`DB_FILENAME`, `BODY_LOG_FILE`,
  `ALLOWLIST_AUDIT_LOG`, `GATEWAY_CERT` and so on) resolve against it, and the metagame finds its
  database migrations at `./src/drizzle`. Start each component from its own folder.
- **File format.** `KEY=value` lines, `#` for comments. Save the file as ASCII or UTF-8 without a
  byte-order mark. In Windows PowerShell 5.1, write it with `Set-Content -Encoding ascii` or
  `Add-Content -Encoding ascii`; `>` and `>>` write UTF-16, which Node cannot read.
- **Restart after every change.** Each component reads its environment when it starts (some values
  once, some on every request, but the environment of a running process never changes). Change the
  file, then restart that component: by hand as in [Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}#stopping),
  or on a kit server with `C:\DauntlessRevived\bin\Stack.ps1 restart -Only <component>` (`metagame`,
  `content`, `deploy`, `gateway` or `allowlist`). Two things change without a restart: an admin can
  switch `REGISTRATION_MODE` at runtime (in memory only, a restart goes back to the file), and the
  content server re-reads the news file and the art pack folder by itself.
- **Unset and empty are not always the same.** In the gateway, the allowlist helper and the content
  server, `KEY=` (or only spaces) counts as unset. In the metagame and the deploy server most values
  are used as they are: `PORT=` listens on a random free port, and `ENTITLEMENTS_DEFAULT=` means no
  default entitlements at all. Leave a line out to get the default.
- **Start from the `.env.example` file.** Each of the four server folders has a commented
  `.env.example` that lists every variable the component reads, with its default, set up for
  development on one PC (everything on `127.0.0.1`, the allowlist helper in dry-run mode). Copy it to
  `.env` and fill in the empty values: the secrets, and the game folder or exe path where one is
  needed. For a host that other people use, follow [Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}#metagame)
  instead. A `.env` file is git-ignored anywhere in the repository, and so are `.env.*` files
  (except `.env.example`) in the metagame, deploy server, gateway and content server folders.

## Feature switches {#feature-switches}

Each switch below changes one behaviour. The fork's own fixes are on by default and each has a way
back to upstream's behaviour, for comparisons. Changes that are still unproven, risky or only for
development are off.

**On by default:**

| Switch | Component | Default | To opt out | Notes |
|:-------|:----------|:--------|:-----------|:------|
| `PROGRESSION_MODE` | metagame | real progression for every account | `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub` (upstream's fake max ranks) | The default changed: a server whose settings have no line used to be on the stub. Read the [upgrade notes]({{ upgrade_page.url | relative_url }}#real-progression-default) before updating a server that already has players. |
| `ENTITLEMENTS_DEFAULT` | metagame | every account owns the Elite Hunt Pass | set your own list | Only for accounts in real progression. |
| `INVENTORY_REPORT_REMOVALS` | metagame | on | `0` | `0` brings back upstream's free-upgrade bug. |
| `MISC_ROUTES` | metagame | on | `0` | Friends list, block list and a few other routes answer instead of 404. |
| `STATUS_EXTRA` | metagame | on | `0` | Server name, version, commit and source link in `/dauntless-status`. |
| `ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME` | metagame | on | `0` | Real usernames in account and party replies. |
| `PROGRESSION_CONFIRM` | metagame | on | `off` | Diagnostic only. |
| `LOG_REQUESTS` | metagame | on | `0` | The request log is the main diagnostic; keep it. |
| `GATEWAY_ALLOWLIST` | gateway | on | `0` | Kill switch: with it off, nobody's game ports open. |
| `ENABLE_DOJO` | deploy server | Dojo starts on first use | `1` starts it at boot, as upstream did | Saves one game process while nobody trains. |

**Off by default:**

| Switch | Component | To turn it on | Why it is off |
|:-------|:----------|:--------------|:--------------|
| `MATCHMAKING_CANCEL` | metagame | `1` | Experimental. The client sends a cancel right after every queued join, and hunts start only because that cancel gets a 404. |
| `INVENTORY_REFUSE_OVERSPEND` | metagame | `1` | Unproven. A refusal drops the whole transaction, rewards included, and no hunt-end transaction has been checked against it yet. |
| `PROGRESSION_ALLOW_DELETE` | metagame | `1` | Lets any game-server call wipe a player's progression track. |
| `DB_WAL` | metagame | `1` | The documented backups copy the database file alone. |
| `LOG_BODIES` | metagame | `1` | Development capture of what players send. The kit forces it off in public mode. |
| `AUTH_MODE=NONE` | metagame | `NONE` | Development only: anyone can log in as anyone. Ignored with `NODE_ENV=production`. |
| `REGISTRATION_MODE=OPEN` | metagame | `OPEN` | Anyone who can reach the metagame gets an account. Only while it listens on loopback. |
| `CONTENT_ALLOW_ANY_BIND` | content server | `1` | Lets the content server listen on a public address. |
| `ALLOWLIST_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | allowlist helper | `1` | Tests and LAN setups only; the kit sets it in sandbox installs. |

`ALLOWLIST_DRY_RUN` has no default: the allowlist helper refuses to start until it is `1` (log what
it would do; any test machine) or `0` (change the firewall; the server).

---

## Metagame (`UndauntedMetagame/`) {#metagame}

The backend the game talks to: logins, characters, inventory, progression, matchmaking and the
`/undaunted/api` management routes. A worked `.env` for one PC is in
[Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}#metagame).

**Required, no default:** `PORT`, `AUTH_MODE`, `AUTH_SIGNING_PRIVKEY_B64`, `AUTH_SIGNING_PUBKEY_B64`,
`DB_FILENAME`, `REGISTRATION_MODE`, `MATCHMAKING_MODE`, `DEPLOYSERVER_URL`, `QOS_TARGET_URL` and
`TARGET_CHANGELIST`. A missing `PORT` or signing key stops the metagame at startup. The others do
not: the metagame starts and then fails in the ways the tables describe.

**When read:** at startup. Restart the metagame after any change. A restart does not log anyone
out (session tokens survive it), but it drops matchmaking queues, parties and the list of who is
online.

**At startup** the metagame logs the address it listens on and a line
`Progression mode: real for every account (the default)` (or which mode it is in). In real mode it
also warns while there are players with no stored progression yet; see the
[upgrade notes]({{ upgrade_page.url | relative_url }}#real-progression-default). With
`GATEWAY_SECRET` set it runs the public-mode checks listed under that variable.

### Listening, logins and the database {#metagame-core}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `PORT` | none. Unset: the metagame stops at startup with a port error. Empty: it listens on a random free port. | 1-65535 | TCP port of the HTTP server. A port that is already taken stops the metagame with `Could not listen on ...`. | You (61000 in the host guide); kit: always (61000, 62000 in sandbox, or `-MetagamePort`) |
| `BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (also when empty) | one IP address | **Fork only.** The one address the metagame listens on. `127.0.0.1` on one PC and in public mode (behind the gateway); the host's Tailscale address (100.x.y.z) in private mode. Avoid `0.0.0.0`: the metagame would also listen on your LAN. | You; kit: always (`127.0.0.1`, or the Tailscale address in private mode) |
| `NODE_ENV` | unset: development | `production` or anything else | `production`: one JSON object per log line, `AUTH_MODE=NONE` has no effect, and error pages carry no stack traces. Anything else: coloured readable logs. Use `production` on anything other people can reach. | You; kit: always `production` |
| `AUTH_MODE` | none. Unset or unknown: logins get no answer at all (the game waits), and every route that checks an account key answers 500. | `APIKEY` or `NONE` (exact) | How logins and account keys are checked. `APIKEY`: the game's login carries the player's account key (`UUK_...`), checked against stored SHA-256 hashes; the player gets a 24-hour session token. `NONE`: development only. Any id is accepted as a login and any account id as an API key, admin routes included. `NONE` is ignored when `NODE_ENV=production` (logins then get no answer), refused for anything that came through a proxy, and the metagame will not start with it while `GATEWAY_SECRET` is set. | You (`APIKEY`); kit: always `APIKEY` |
| `AUTH_SIGNING_PRIVKEY_B64` | none. Unset: the metagame stops at startup. Empty: it starts, but every login fails. | base64 of a PEM RSA private key (PKCS#8) | **Secret: never share, never commit.** Signs the players' session tokens (RS256, valid 24 hours). Whoever has it can sign in as any account. Replacing the key pair only logs everyone out. Back it up encrypted. | You ([Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}#metagame) shows how to generate it); kit: kept from the existing file or the backup, otherwise generated once |
| `AUTH_SIGNING_PUBKEY_B64` | none. Unset: the metagame stops at startup. | base64 of the matching PEM public key (SPKI) | Checks every session token. Not secret, but it must belong to the private key, or every signed-in request fails. | Generated together with the private key |
| `REGISTRATION_MODE` | none. Unset or unknown: account creation answers 500. | `NONE`, `INVITECODE` or `OPEN` (exact) | Who may create an account (`POST /undaunted/api/Register`). `NONE`: nobody (400). `INVITECODE`: only with a usable invite code (401 otherwise). `OPEN`: anyone who can reach the metagame, so use it only while the metagame listens on `127.0.0.1`. An admin can change it at runtime; that lasts until the next restart. | You (`OPEN` on one PC); kit: always `INVITECODE` (a hand-set value is overwritten on every installer run) |
| `DB_FILENAME` | none. Unset or empty: a temporary database that is deleted when the metagame exits. | file path, forward slashes; relative to the working directory | The SQLite database: accounts, key hashes, saves, progression. Its folder must exist. Pending migrations run at every start, without a backup first, so back up before you update. The file is private: it holds usernames, saves, key hashes and, until the next start, keys queued for registration in plain text. `npm run db:generate` reads it from `.env` too. | You (`C:/dr/data/undaunted.db` in the host guide); kit: always (`<root>/data/undaunted.db`) |
| `DB_WAL` | off | `1` or anything else | `1` switches SQLite to WAL journal mode. Off because the documented backups copy the database file alone and the kit stops the metagame hard, so the newest saves could sit only in the separate `-wal` file. With it off, a database left in WAL mode is switched back at startup. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |

### Matchmaking and the client {#metagame-matchmaking}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `MATCHMAKING_MODE` | none. Unset or unknown: every matchmaking request is refused (400). | `DEPLOYSERVER` or `DISABLED` (exact) | `DEPLOYSERVER`: game servers come from the deploy server. `DISABLED`: refuse all matchmaking. | You; kit: always `DEPLOYSERVER` |
| `DEPLOYSERVER_URL` | none. Unset: every launch fails, and the server status lists no worlds. | `host:port` without `http://` | Where the deploy server listens; the metagame adds `http://` and the path. Keep it on `127.0.0.1`: the deploy server has no authentication and refuses every other caller. | You (`127.0.0.1:61001`); kit: always `127.0.0.1:<deploy port>` |
| `QOS_TARGET_URL` | none. Unset: the region list the client pings holds only `null` (what the client does then is untested). | full URL ending in `/QoS` | The one "region" the client pings before matchmaking; the metagame answers `GET /QoS` itself. One PC: `http://127.0.0.1:61000/QoS`. Private mode: the same with the Tailscale address. Public mode: `http://127.0.0.1:61000/QoS`, which is each friend's own launcher relay. | You; kit: always (public: `http://127.0.0.1:61000/QoS`; private: `http://<Tailscale address>:<metagame port>/QoS`) |
| `TARGET_CHANGELIST` | none. Unset: the build id becomes `undefined_1.4.4_shipping`. | `239827` | Sent to the client as the build id `<changelist>_1.4.4_shipping` in the reply that sends it to a game server. Whether the 1.4.4 client checks it is not known; keep `239827`, the changelist in `Version.txt`. | You; kit: always `239827` |

### Public mode and game-server callers {#metagame-public-mode}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `GATEWAY_SECRET` | unset or empty: public mode off, forwarding headers are never trusted | 32 to 256 printable characters without spaces (the gateway enforces this; the kit makes 64 hex characters) | **Secret: never share, never commit.** Turns on public mode. Only a request from loopback whose `X-Dauntless-Gateway` header equals this value counts as relayed by the gateway, and only then is its `X-Forwarded-For` taken as the player's address. Must equal `GATEWAY_SECRET` in the gateway's settings. At startup, `AUTH_MODE` other than `APIKEY` stops the metagame; a secret shorter than 16 characters, a `BIND_HOST` that is not loopback, `NODE_ENV` other than `production`, or a `QOS_TARGET_URL` other than `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/QoS` log a warning. | Kit: public mode only (the same value as in `gateway.env`, kept across re-runs, removed in private mode) |
| `GAMESERVER_ALLOW_FROM` | none | comma-separated IP addresses; other entries are ignored | Extra addresses allowed to present the game-server key, for a game server on another machine. By default the key is accepted only from this machine (loopback or one of its own addresses) and never through a proxy. List only machines you control; they still need the key. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |

### Logging {#metagame-logging}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` (also when empty) | `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `silent` | Log threshold. | Nobody by default |
| `LOG_REQUESTS` | on | `0` or anything else | **Fork only.** One line per request: `METHOD /path gs=0` (`gs=1` when the request carried the game-server key). Behind the gateway the line ends with ` via=gateway ip=<player address>`; other forwarded requests get ` via=proxy peer=<address>`. Only the path is logged, never the query string or headers, and token-shaped parts of the path are replaced. `0` turns it off. | Nobody by default |
| `LOG_BODIES` | off | `1` or anything else | **Fork only.** `1` appends the request bodies of unfinished routes (progression, Hunt Pass, bounties, cooldowns, escalation, entitlements, loadout unlocks, store, SKUs and balance, matchmaking, party, friends, inventory and account lookups) to `BODY_LOG_FILE`: one JSON object per line with the time, method, URL (query string included), whether the game-server key was present, and the body cut at 8 KB (64 KB for inventory). Token-shaped strings are removed from the URL and the body. A development aid: the file records what players send, so keep it private and never turn it on for a public server. | Nobody by default; kit: forced to `0` in public mode, kept in private mode |
| `BODY_LOG_FILE` | `bodies.log` in the working directory | file path | Where `LOG_BODIES` writes. The file is never rotated. `UndauntedMetagame/bodies.log` is not git-ignored: point this outside the repository (for example `C:/dr/data/bodies.log`) and never commit the file. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/logs/bodies.log`) |

### Server identity {#metagame-identity}

These values are **public**: anyone can read them from `GET /dauntless-status`, and registered
players from `GET /undaunted/api/ServerStatus` (see [HTTP API]({{ api_page.url | relative_url }})).

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `SERVER_NAME` | `Dauntless Revived` | printable ASCII, cut to 64 characters | The server's name in the status replies, and in the in-game welcome text of `/dauntless-status` (`Welcome to <name>!`, translated into each of the eight languages the reply carries). | Kit: always, from `-ServerName` (default `Dauntless Revived`). The installer does not remember it: pass `-ServerName` on every run, or the name goes back to the default. |
| `SERVER_VERSION` | the version recorded at build time (`dist/build-info.json`), then `package.json`, then `unknown` | printable ASCII, up to 32 characters | Version in the status replies. | Nobody by default |
| `GIT_COMMIT` | the commit recorded at build time (with `-dirty` if the metagame folder had uncommitted changes), then `unknown` | up to 64 characters of letters, digits and `._+-`; anything else is ignored | The commit the running code came from. | Kit: always (the installed commit); `Update-DauntlessServer.ps1` rewrites it on every update and rollback |
| `SOURCE_URL` | `https://github.com/mixutin/dauntless-revived` | URL, printable ASCII, up to 256 characters | Where the source of the running server is, for the AGPL source offer ([Credits and license]({{ legal_page.url | relative_url }})). If you run modified code for other people, point it at your modified source. | Kit: always the repository URL from `deploy/windows-server/DauntlessServer.Common.ps1`, so a hand edit is overwritten on the next installer run; a fork changes it there |
| `CONTENT_PORT` | unset or invalid: none reported | 1-65535 | Tells launchers which port the content server (game downloads, news, art) uses. | Kit: always when the content server is installed (61002), removed otherwise |
| `STATUS_EXTRA` | on | `0` or anything else | **Fork only.** `GET /dauntless-status` adds `name`, `version`, `commit` and `sourceUrl` after the nine fields the game reads. `0` answers the nine fields only, as upstream did. The route answers anyone and never names players. | Nobody by default |

### Progression {#metagame-progression}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `PROGRESSION_MODE` | real for every account (unset, empty or `real`) | `real` or `stub`, any case; any other value (such as `off`, `0` or `false`, which used to mean the stub) logs a warning, counts as `real`, and the startup line then reads `real for every account (PROGRESSION_MODE=<value> is not recognised)` | **Fork only.** Real: every account stores its own Slayer level, weapon and behemoth mastery, objectives, Hunt Pass, entitlements, loadout slots, cooldowns and bounties. `stub`: upstream's fake max ranks for everyone, nothing stored. **Changed default:** before, an unset value meant the stub. Nothing is migrated; read the [upgrade notes]({{ upgrade_page.url | relative_url }}#real-progression-default). | Nobody by default; kit: never written, kept |
| `PROGRESSION_REAL_ACCOUNTS` | none | comma-separated account ids (`UID-...`) | Only with `PROGRESSION_MODE=stub`: these accounts get real progression anyway. Ignored in real mode (the startup line says so when it is set). | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `PROGRESSION_GRANT_CAP` | `5000` (also when not a positive whole number) | positive whole number | The most XP one request may add to one track. More is cut to the cap and noted in the progression audit table. | Nobody by default |
| `PROGRESSION_CONFIRM` | on | `off` or anything else | `off` makes the rank-confirm route answer 404 again for real-mode accounts, as upstream did. A diagnostic switch; leave it unset. | Nobody by default |
| `PROGRESSION_ALLOW_DELETE` | off | `1` or anything else | `1` lets game servers reset a progression track (the game sends that only from a debug command). Without it only an admin key can. With it on, any game-server call can wipe a player's track. | Nobody by default |
| `ENTITLEMENTS_DEFAULT` | `season09b_premium,season_premium_any,season_free_any` when unset | comma-separated entitlement names; empty means none | Entitlements every real-mode account owns. `season09b_premium` is the Elite Hunt Pass. Each default is added to an account once, the first time its entitlements are read; removing a name later does not take it back, and a default an admin revoked stays revoked. | Nobody by default |

### Saves and inventory {#metagame-saves}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `SAVE_HISTORY_KEEP` | `100` (also when below 2 or not a whole number) | whole number, 2 or more | How many of the newest versions of each character's data, and separately of its loadouts, are always kept for rollbacks. 100 is roughly the last 50 minutes of play. | Nobody by default |
| `SAVE_HISTORY_HOURLY` | `48` (also when empty, negative or not a whole number) | whole number of hours, 0 or more (0 turns this tier off) | Beyond those, the last version of each hour is kept for this many hours. | Nobody by default |
| `SAVE_HISTORY_DAILY` | `30` (also when empty, negative or not a whole number) | whole number of days, 0 or more (0 turns this tier off) | And the last version of each day for this many days. At the defaults that is at most about 3.5 MB per character. | Nobody by default |
| `INVENTORY_REFUSE_OVERSPEND` | off | `1` or anything else | `1` refuses (409) an inventory transaction that removes more than the player has. Off because a refusal drops the whole transaction, rewards included; meanwhile an overspend is clamped at 0 and logged. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `INVENTORY_REPORT_REMOVALS` | on | `0` or anything else | **Fork only.** Inventory replies list every stack the transaction touched with its final count (0 for a used-up stack), so the game server sees what was spent. `0` puts back upstream's additions-only reply, which made upgrades free. | Nobody by default |

### Compatibility switches {#metagame-compatibility}

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `MISC_ROUTES` | on | `0` or anything else | **Fork only.** Answers routes that were 404 upstream: the friends list and block list, recent players, friend settings, `POST /candidate/player/alive` and `GET /motd/trigger`. `0` puts the 404s back. | Nobody by default |
| `ACCOUNT_DISPLAY_NAME` | on | `0` or anything else | **Fork only.** Account and party replies carry the real username as `displayName`. `0` puts back upstream's empty `{}`. | Nobody by default |
| `MATCHMAKING_CANCEL` | off | `1` or anything else | **Fork only, experimental.** `1` answers the client's matchmaking cancel (`DELETE /candidate`, and `DELETE /candidate/leave`). Off because the client sends that cancel right after every queued join, and hunts start only because it gets a 404. | Nobody by default |

---

## Deploy server (`UndauntedDeployServer/`) {#deploy-server}

Starts and watches the game-server processes when the metagame asks. A worked `.env` is in
[Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}#deploy-server).

**When read:** once, at startup. Restart the deploy server after any change, and stop it before the
metagame; see [Run it for a group]({{ admin_page.url | relative_url }}#restarting-after-a-change).
The deploy server checks none of these values: a missing one is not reported at startup, it only
makes launches fail later. Every game server it starts inherits its whole environment, the
game-server key included.

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `PORT` | none. Unset: it stops at startup with a port error. Empty: it listens on a random port the metagame cannot find. | 1-65535 | HTTP port. Only the metagame on the same machine calls it, through `DEPLOYSERVER_URL`. | You (61001); kit: always (61001, 62001 in sandbox, or `-DeployPort`) |
| `BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` (also when empty) | one IP address | **Fork only.** Listen address. Keep `127.0.0.1`: there is no authentication, and anyone who reaches the port can start game processes. Both of its routes also refuse any caller that is not loopback or that came through a proxy. | You; kit: always `127.0.0.1` |
| `MY_IP` | none. Unset: every launch fails. | IPv4 address as players reach it | The address handed to clients for every game server (Ramsgate, the Dojo, hunts). `127.0.0.1` for play on one PC, the Tailscale address in private mode, the server's public IPv4 in public mode (for example `203.0.113.10`). With `127.0.0.1` on a shared server, a friend's game connects to its own PC. | You; kit: always (public mode: the IPv4 of the public host, which is `-PublicHost`, else the one saved at the last install, else the network adapter's only public IPv4; the Tailscale address in private mode; `127.0.0.1` in sandbox) |
| `PORT_RANGE_BEGIN` | none. Unset: no hunt ports, every hunt fails. | UDP port | Lowest game-server port. Hunts use `PORT_RANGE_BEGIN` up to `PORT_RANGE_END - 2`: six at a time with 8770-8777. To allow more at once on a hand-built host, lower it and open the extra ports too. | You (8770); kit: always 8770 |
| `PORT_RANGE_END` | none. Unset: Ramsgate cannot start. | keep `8777` | Ramsgate always runs on this port and the Training Dojo on the one below. Keep 8777: the server DLL turns its 50-second idle shutdown off for ports 8776 and up, so another value leaves hunts that never exit or a Ramsgate that keeps exiting. | You (8777); kit: always 8777 |
| `GAMESERVER_BINARY_PATH` | none. Unset or wrong: the deploy server stops soon after start (from reading the code). | full path of `Dauntless-Win64-Shipping.exe`, forward slashes | The 1.4.4 game exe started as each game server; `dxgi.dll` and `UndauntedInternalServer.dll` must sit next to it. Whatever file this names is run with the game-server key on its command line, so only administrators may edit the file. | You; kit: always (`<root>/game/Dauntless/Archon/Binaries/Win64/Dauntless-Win64-Shipping.exe`) |
| `METAGAME_API_KEY` | none. Unset: game servers cannot talk to the metagame. | the game-server key (48 hex characters as generated) | **Secret: never share, never commit.** Passed to every game server as its first command-line argument; the server DLL sends it with every request to the metagame, which stores only its SHA-256. It must match `gameserver.key` and be registered in the metagame's database. Local users can see it in the game servers' command lines. | You ([Host a server]({{ host_page.url | relative_url }}#metagame)); kit: always (kept from the backup, the key file or the old file, otherwise new) |
| `SECONDS_TO_WAIT_BETWEEN_GAMESERVER_STARTUP` | none. Unset: effectively no gap. | seconds; decimals work | Minimum gap between two game-server launches. All launches wait in one queue, so the third hunt requested at the same moment starts about two gaps later. | You (10); kit: 10 when missing or empty, a hand-set value is kept |
| `ENABLE_DOJO` | on demand | `1` or anything else | **Fork only.** `1` starts the Training Dojo at boot, as upstream did. Anything else: it starts the first time someone is matchmade into it, and the watchdog restarts it from then on. | You (0); kit: 0 when missing, kept otherwise |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` (also when empty) | `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`, `silent` | Log threshold. At `info` the matchmaking line lists the expected players' account ids; the key is never logged. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `NODE_ENV` | unset: coloured readable logs | `production` or anything else | `production`: JSON log lines, and no stack traces in error pages. | You; kit: always `production` |

## Gateway (`UndauntedGateway/`, `dist/server.js`) {#gateway}

The only public TCP listener in public mode. It terminates TLS and passes requests to the metagame
and the content server on loopback. The gateway's own [README]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/dauntless-revived/UndauntedGateway/README.md)
explains routing, refusals and how the limits were sized.

**When read:** once, at startup. A value outside its range stops the gateway with an error that names
the variable. It also refuses to start with a certificate that is expired, not yet valid or does not
match the key, and warns when fewer than 30 days remain. `NODE_ENV` has no effect here.

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `GATEWAY_BIND` | `0.0.0.0` | an IP address (no host names) | Address of the TLS listener. Keep `0.0.0.0` (IPv4): the address the gateway reports to the allowlist must be the IPv4 the player's game traffic comes from. | Kit: always (`0.0.0.0`; `127.0.0.1` in sandbox) |
| `GATEWAY_PORT` | `443` | 1-65535 | TLS port, and the port in public invites. The only port the kit opens to everyone; the game's UDP ports open only for players who logged in (see the allowlist helper below). | Kit: always (443 or `-GatewayPort`; 62443 in sandbox) |
| `GATEWAY_CERT` | none, required | path of a PEM certificate | The certificate served over TLS. The gateway logs its SHA-256 fingerprint, which every invite pins. A new certificate breaks every invite already sent. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/tls/gateway-cert.pem`) |
| `GATEWAY_KEY` | none, required | path of the PEM private key | **Secret file: never share, never commit.** The certificate's private key. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/tls/gateway-key.pem`) |
| `GATEWAY_SECRET` | none, required | 32 to 256 printable characters without spaces | **Secret: never share, never commit.** Sent as `X-Dauntless-Gateway` with every request the gateway passes on (to the metagame, the content server and the WebSocket service); only the metagame checks it, and it must equal the metagame's `GATEWAY_SECRET`. A copy of that header sent by a client is dropped. Never logged. | Kit: always (64 hex characters, kept across re-runs) |
| `GATEWAY_METAGAME_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:61000` | `http://host:port` on this machine only (`127.x.x.x`, `::1` or `localhost`), no path | Where every request goes that is not `/content` or a WebSocket upgrade. Loopback is enforced so the secret header never leaves the machine. | Kit: always |
| `GATEWAY_CONTENT_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:61002` | same rule | Where `/content` and `/content/...` go (the content server). | Kit: always |
| `GATEWAY_WS_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:61099` | same rule | Where WebSocket upgrades go (a future chat service). Nothing listens there yet, so upgrades get 502. | Kit: always (61099; 62099 in sandbox) |
| `GATEWAY_ALLOWLIST` | on | exactly `0` turns it off | Kill switch for reporting logged-in players' addresses to the allowlist helper. Off: the `ALLOWLIST_*` values are ignored, a warning is logged, and no player's game ports open unless you manage the firewall another way. | Nobody; never written by the kit |
| `ALLOWLIST_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:61005` | `http://host:port` on this machine only | Where the gateway reports player addresses. | Kit: always |
| `ALLOWLIST_SECRET` | none; required unless `GATEWAY_ALLOWLIST=0` | 32 to 256 printable characters without spaces | **Secret: never share, never commit.** Sent to the allowlist helper; must equal the helper's `ALLOWLIST_SECRET`. On a kit server `gateway.env` holds this copy and is readable by the service account the gateway runs as. | Kit: always (the same value as in `allowlist.env`, kept across re-runs) |
| `GATEWAY_ALLOWLIST_REFRESH_SECONDS` | `60` | 5-540 | How long the gateway waits before reporting the same address again. Keep it well under the helper's `ALLOWLIST_TTL_SECONDS`. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `131072` (128 KiB) | 1024-67108864 | Largest request body; a larger one gets 413. The largest body the game sends, a character save, is about 22 KB. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `2048` | 1-100000 | Open connections in total. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP` | `128` | 1-100000 | Open connections per IPv4 address or IPv6 /64. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_RATE_GENERAL` | `300,180` | `<burst>,<per minute>` | Request rate for all game traffic not in the buckets below. An empty bucket answers 429 with `Retry-After`. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_RATE_CONTENT` | `600,600` | `<burst>,<per minute>` | Request rate for `/content` downloads. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_RATE_REGISTER` | `5,0.2` | `<burst>,<per minute>` | Request rate for account creation: five at once, then one every five minutes. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_RATE_TOKEN` | `10,1` | `<burst>,<per minute>` | Request rate for logins. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_RATE_CONNECT` | `200,300` | `<burst>,<per minute>` | Rate of new TCP connections (each costs a TLS handshake). An empty bucket closes the connection without an answer. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | 1000-120000 | TLS handshake timeout. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_HEADERS_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | 1000-120000 | Time allowed for a request's headers (answers 408). Also the upstream timeout for a WebSocket handshake. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `30000` | 1000-600000 | Time allowed for a whole request, body included (answers 408). | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `65000` | 1000-600000 | Idle keep-alive time between requests. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | 1000-3600000 | A client connection that moves no data for this long is closed. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_UPSTREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | 1000-3600000 | An upstream request that stays silent this long is aborted (504). | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_WS_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | 1000-86400000 | Idle timeout of a joined WebSocket, on both sides. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `GATEWAY_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS` | `10000` | 0-300000 | On a stop signal, requests in flight get this long to finish before every connection is cut. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`, any case; anything else means `info` | Log threshold. `debug` also logs failed TLS handshakes. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |

The rate buckets count per IPv4 address or IPv6 /64. `<burst>` is how many requests fit in a bucket at
once and `<per minute>` how many it refills per minute: `<burst>` 1-1000000, `<per minute>` at most
1000000 and decimals allowed. Every request uses up a token before any other check, refused ones
included.

## Allowlist helper (`UndauntedGateway/`, `dist/allowlist/server.js`) {#allowlist-helper}

A small service that keeps one Windows Firewall rule open to the addresses of logged-in players. It
runs with administrator rights (as SYSTEM on a kit server), so its settings file is readable only by
administrators and SYSTEM.

**When read:** once, at startup. Invalid values stop the helper with an error that names the
variable. `NODE_ENV` has no effect here.

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `ALLOWLIST_DRY_RUN` | none, required | `0` or `1` | `1`: never touches the firewall; every change it would make is written to the audit log. `0`: really changes the firewall; needs Windows and administrator rights, or the helper exits. Use `1` on every machine that is not the server. | Kit: always (`0`; `1` with `-AllowlistDryRun` or `-Sandbox`) |
| `ALLOWLIST_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | `127.0.0.1` or `::1` only | Listen address. Anything else is refused at startup. | Kit: always `127.0.0.1` |
| `ALLOWLIST_PORT` | `61005` | 1-65535 | Listen port; must match the gateway's `ALLOWLIST_URL`. | Kit: always (61005, 62005 in sandbox, or `-AllowlistPort`) |
| `ALLOWLIST_SECRET` | none, required | 32 to 256 printable characters without spaces | **Secret: never share, never commit.** Every request to the helper must carry it; must equal the gateway's `ALLOWLIST_SECRET`. Never logged. | Kit: always (kept across re-runs) |
| `ALLOWLIST_PORTS` | `8770-8777` | one port or a range `low-high` | The local UDP ports the firewall rule opens. Must match the deploy server's port range. | Kit: always `8770-8777` |
| `ALLOWLIST_TTL_SECONDS` | `600` | 1-86400 | How long an address stays open after its last report. | Kit: always `600` (a hand-set value is overwritten) |
| `ALLOWLIST_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `3000` | 50-600000 | Minimum time between two firewall rule changes; changes in between are combined. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `ALLOWLIST_MAX_ENTRIES` | `256` | 1-1000 | Most addresses open at once; a new one beyond that is refused. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `ALLOWLIST_AUDIT_LOG` | `allowlist-audit.log` in the working directory | file path | Append-only log, one JSON object per line, of every change and refusal (addresses added, expired or refused, rule changes, requests with a wrong secret). It contains player IP addresses, never the secret. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/allowlist/audit.log`) |
| `ALLOWLIST_STATE_FILE` | `allowlist-state.json` in the working directory | file path | The open addresses, saved so a restart re-opens the ports for the same players. Contains player IP addresses. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/allowlist/state.json`) |
| `ALLOWLIST_ALLOW_PRIVATE` | off | exactly `1` turns it on | Also accepts private, CGNAT (including Tailscale), loopback and link-local addresses. For tests and LAN setups; keep it off on a public server. | Kit: `1` in sandbox installs only, removed otherwise |
| `ALLOWLIST_POWERSHELL` | `%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` (`C:\Windows` if `SystemRoot` is unset) | full path of an executable | The PowerShell the helper runs, with administrator rights, for every firewall change. Leave it unset. Anyone who can edit this setting can run any program as administrator, which is why the kit makes `allowlist.env` readable only by administrators and SYSTEM. | Nobody; kit: kept |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`, any case | Log threshold. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |

## Content server (`UndauntedContent/`) {#content-server}

Serves the verified game files to registered accounts, plus the host's news and art for the
launcher. Details of the news file and the art pack (`branding.json`) are on
[Files and data]({{ files_page.url | relative_url }}).

**When read:** once, at startup. Invalid values stop the content server with an error that names the
variable. The news file and the art pack folder themselves are re-read while it runs (news within
5 seconds, art within 10), so editing them needs no restart. `NODE_ENV` has no effect here.

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `PORT` | `61002` | 1-65535 | Listen port. | You; kit: always (61002, 62002 in sandbox, or `-ContentPort`) |
| `BIND_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | comma-separated IP addresses or `localhost` | Listen addresses, one listener each. Only loopback and Tailscale addresses (100.64.0.0/10, fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48) are accepted; anything else, `0.0.0.0` included, needs `CONTENT_ALLOW_ANY_BIND=1`. | You; kit: always (`127.0.0.1` in public mode, the Tailscale address in private mode) |
| `CONTENT_ALLOW_ANY_BIND` | off | exactly `1` turns it on | Lifts the `BIND_HOST` check. Only if a firewall keeps the internet out: game files must never be reachable from the internet directly. | Nobody; never written by the kit |
| `METAGAME_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:61000` | `http://` or `https://` URL | Where account keys are checked (`GET /undaunted/api/GetUserInfo`). Every downloader's key is sent here, so it must point at your own metagame. | Kit: always (`http://<metagame address>:<port>`) |
| `CONTENT_GAME_DIR` | none, required | folder path | The verified 1.4.4 install (the folder that contains `Archon\`), opened read-only. Only files listed in the manifest are ever served. `npm run verify -- --game-dir <folder>` overrides it for a check. | You; kit: always (`<root>/game/Dauntless`) |
| `CONTENT_MANIFEST` | the built-in `data/dauntless-1.4.4.json` | file path | Another manifest, for tests with a stand-in game folder. | Kit: only in sandbox with `-ContentManifest`, removed otherwise |
| `CONTENT_BRANDING_DIR` | unset: no art | folder path | The host's art pack for the launcher: images plus an optional `branding.json`. Share only art you have the rights to. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/branding`) |
| `CONTENT_NEWS_FILE` | unset: no news | file path | The host's news for the launcher. A broken edit keeps the last good version online. | Kit: always (`<root>/data/config/news.json`, created empty if missing) |
| `CONTENT_MAX_STREAMS_PER_ACCOUNT` | `6` | 1-64 | Downloads one account may run at once (429 above it). | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `CONTENT_MAX_STREAMS_TOTAL` | `48` | 1-1024 | Downloads the whole server runs at once (503 above it). | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `CONTENT_AUTH_CACHE_SECONDS` | `300` | 0-3600 | How long a good key's check is cached (keyed by a hash of the key, never the key itself). Refused keys are cached for 30 seconds; metagame outages are never cached. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error`, any case | Log threshold. | Nobody by default; kit: kept |

The content server holds no secrets of its own. Account keys pass through it to the metagame and are
never logged.

## Launcher environment overrides {#launcher}

The friend launcher has a settings page of its own (graphics, auto exposure, window, language). Where it keeps them
is on [Files and data]({{ files_page.url | relative_url }}), and what the graphics level writes into the game's
ini files on [Game settings]({{ gamesettings_page.url | relative_url }}). From its environment it
reads only the variables below.

| Name | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `DAUNTLESS_REVIVED_RELAY_PORT` | unset: 61000 | whole number 1024-65535 without a leading zero; anything else is ignored | For tests only, for example on a PC where the development stack already holds 61000. In public mode it moves the launcher's local relay, the address the game is started with and the game's chat port in `Engine.ini` to this port, and the launcher logs a warning. Private mode ignores it. Friends must keep 61000: the server hands every player `http://127.0.0.1:61000/QoS`. | A developer or tester, in the launcher's environment (`$env:DAUNTLESS_REVIVED_RELAY_PORT = "62100"` before starting it). Never set by any installer or kit. |
| `LOCALAPPDATA` (`USERPROFILE` as a fallback) | set by Windows | folder | Default game folder (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\DauntlessRevived\Game`), the game's user config folder the launcher rewrites, and one place it looks for `tailscale.exe`. | Windows |
| `ProgramW6432`, `ProgramFiles`, `ProgramFiles(x86)`, `PATH` | set by Windows | folders | Where else the launcher looks for `tailscale.exe` (private mode only). `C:\Program Files\Tailscale` is always tried. | Windows |
| `WINDIR` (`SystemRoot` as a fallback) | set by Windows | folder | Where it checks for the Visual C++ runtime the server DLL needs. | Windows |

The installed launcher ignores `NODE_OPTIONS`, `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` and the Node inspector flags:
they are switched off when the app is packaged, so nobody can inject code into it through the
environment.

---

## What the Windows server kit writes {#server-kit}

`Install-DauntlessServer.ps1` writes the five files in `<root>\data\config\` (default root
`C:\DauntlessRevived`). On every run it reads the existing file, and with `-RestoreFrom` also the
backup's `metagame.env` and `deployserver.env` (the backup's values win), keeps every key it finds,
and then sets the keys that describe this host. So a setting you add by hand, such as
`PROGRESSION_MODE=stub`, survives installer re-runs and updates; a hand-edited key from the "always
set" column does not. Change those through the installer's parameters instead
([Scripts and parameters]({{ scripts_page.url | relative_url }})).

Other rules:

- Comment lines are not kept: the file is rewritten with one header line.
- Values containing a quote, a backslash or a line break are refused, so paths are written with
  forward slashes.
- `Update-DauntlessServer.ps1` changes only `GIT_COMMIT` in `metagame.env`.
- Ports come from `-MetagamePort`, `-DeployPort`, `-ContentPort`, `-AllowlistPort` and
  `-GatewayPort`, else from the existing install's `server.json`, else the defaults on
  [Ports and network]({{ ports_page.url | relative_url }}).
- `NODE_ENV=production` is written into all five files. Only the metagame and the deploy server read
  it.

| File | Written | Always set by the installer | Set only when missing | Removed | Kept (yours) |
|:-----|:--------|:----------------------------|:----------------------|:--------|:-------------|
| `metagame.env` | every run | `PORT`, `BIND_HOST`, `AUTH_MODE`, `DB_FILENAME`, `TARGET_CHANGELIST`, `QOS_TARGET_URL`, `MATCHMAKING_MODE`, `DEPLOYSERVER_URL`, `REGISTRATION_MODE`, `NODE_ENV`, `SERVER_NAME`, `SOURCE_URL`, `GIT_COMMIT`, `BODY_LOG_FILE`; in public mode also `GATEWAY_SECRET` and `LOG_BODIES=0`; with the content server also `CONTENT_PORT` | `AUTH_SIGNING_PRIVKEY_B64`, `AUTH_SIGNING_PUBKEY_B64` (a new pair) | `GATEWAY_SECRET` in private mode; `CONTENT_PORT` without the content server | everything else, for example `PROGRESSION_*`, `SAVE_HISTORY_*`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `DB_WAL` |
| `deployserver.env` | every run (also in sandbox, where no deploy server runs) | `PORT`, `BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `MY_IP`, `PORT_RANGE_BEGIN=8770`, `PORT_RANGE_END=8777`, `GAMESERVER_BINARY_PATH`, `METAGAME_API_KEY`, `NODE_ENV` | `SECONDS_TO_WAIT_BETWEEN_GAMESERVER_STARTUP=10` (also when empty), `ENABLE_DOJO=0` | nothing | `LOG_LEVEL`, your `ENABLE_DOJO` and wait time |
| `content.env` | when the installed code has the content server | `PORT`, `BIND_HOST`, `METAGAME_URL`, `CONTENT_GAME_DIR`, `CONTENT_BRANDING_DIR`, `CONTENT_NEWS_FILE`, `NODE_ENV` | nothing | `CONTENT_MANIFEST` (unless sandbox `-ContentManifest`) | `CONTENT_MAX_STREAMS_*`, `CONTENT_AUTH_CACHE_SECONDS`, `LOG_LEVEL` |
| `gateway.env` | public mode | `GATEWAY_BIND`, `GATEWAY_PORT`, `GATEWAY_CERT`, `GATEWAY_KEY`, `GATEWAY_SECRET`, `GATEWAY_METAGAME_URL`, `GATEWAY_CONTENT_URL`, `GATEWAY_WS_URL`, `ALLOWLIST_URL`, `ALLOWLIST_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV` | nothing | `GATEWAY_CHAT_URL`, `GATEWAY_ACCESS_LOG` (names from early drafts) | limits, rates, timeouts, `GATEWAY_ALLOWLIST_REFRESH_SECONDS`, `LOG_LEVEL` |
| `allowlist.env` | public mode | `ALLOWLIST_BIND`, `ALLOWLIST_PORT`, `ALLOWLIST_SECRET`, `ALLOWLIST_PORTS`, `ALLOWLIST_TTL_SECONDS=600`, `ALLOWLIST_AUDIT_LOG`, `ALLOWLIST_STATE_FILE`, `ALLOWLIST_DRY_RUN`, `NODE_ENV`; in sandbox also `ALLOWLIST_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1` | nothing | `ALLOWLIST_ALLOW_PRIVATE` outside sandbox; `ALLOWLIST_RULE_NAME`, `ALLOWLIST_UDP_PORTS`, `ALLOWLIST_PROGRAM` (names from early drafts) | `ALLOWLIST_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`, `ALLOWLIST_MAX_ENTRIES`, `ALLOWLIST_POWERSHELL`, `LOG_LEVEL` |

**Where the secrets come from.** The token-signing pair is kept from the backup or the existing file,
otherwise generated once (RSA-2048). The game-server key (48 hex characters) is kept from the backup,
then `data\keys\gameserver.key`, then the old `deployserver.env`, otherwise generated. `GATEWAY_SECRET`
and `ALLOWLIST_SECRET` (64 hex characters each) are kept across re-runs and generated fresh on a new
machine; a restore does not need them. The installer never prints any of them.

**Who can read the files.** `data\config\` is read-only for the service account that runs the
stack, and `allowlist.env` is readable only by administrators and SYSTEM. Edit the files from an
elevated editor, then restart the component with `Stack.ps1 restart -Only <component>`.

**Backups.** `Backup-DauntlessServer.ps1` copies `metagame.env`, `deployserver.env`, `content.env` and
`gateway.env` into `backups\<date>_<time>\secrets\`, together with the `*.key` files from
`data\keys\` and the gateway's TLS certificate and key. `allowlist.env` is not copied (only administrators and SYSTEM can read it, and an
install on a new machine makes a new allowlist secret). `gateway.env` carries copies of
`GATEWAY_SECRET` and `ALLOWLIST_SECRET`, so a backup holds every secret of the server: copy backups
off the server only encrypted, and never commit them.

---

## Friend kit and client side {#client-side}

The friend kit (`friend-kit/`) and the launcher set nothing on the server. The friend kit's
`play.ps1` takes the server as `-Server host[:port]` (port 61000 when left out) and passes it to the
game as its first command-line argument; the launcher takes the address from the invite. Both keep
the player's account key on the player's PC. See [Join as a friend]({{ friends_page.url | relative_url }})
and [Game settings]({{ gamesettings_page.url | relative_url }}).

---

## Windows variables the scripts read {#windows-variables}

The server kit's scripts and the friend kit take a few standard Windows variables from their own
process. You do not set these yourself; the table says what each is used for.

| Name | Read by | What it is used for |
|:-----|:--------|:--------------------|
| `SSH_CONNECTION` | `Install-DauntlessServer.ps1` | Set by the OpenSSH server. When the installer runs over SSH (as `Deploy-Remote.ps1` does), the key login has been proven, so it turns SSH password login off. From the console or Remote Desktop it only warns. |
| `COMPUTERNAME` | the server kit | Forms the service account's name, `<COMPUTERNAME>\dauntless`. |
| `WINDIR`, `ProgramFiles`, `ProgramData`, `Path`, `TEMP` | the server kit | `System32` tools (`tar.exe`, `cmd.exe`, OpenSSH), `nodejs\node.exe` and `Tailscale\tailscale.exe`, `ssh\sshd_config`. The installer adds the Node.js folder to `Path` for its own session. `Deploy-Remote.ps1` stages uploads under `%TEMP%`. |
| `APPDATA`, `LOCALAPPDATA`, `WINDIR` | friend kit (`setup.ps1`, `play.ps1`) | `%APPDATA%\DauntlessRevived\` holds `account.key` (**secret: never share it, never commit it**) and `settings.json`; `play.ps1` writes the game's ini files under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Archon\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\`; `setup.ps1` checks `%WINDIR%\System32` for the Visual C++ runtime. |

When the kit builds the code (`npm ci`, `npm run build`) it sets `NODE_ENV=development`, so that
TypeScript is installed, and turns off npm's update, funding and audit messages. That is only the
build step: the running components get `NODE_ENV=production` from their `.env` files.

## CI and release settings {#ci-settings}

These are not read by any server component. They are settings of the GitHub repository, read by the
workflows in `.github/workflows/` ([Developer guide]({{ dev_page.url | relative_url }}#ci)). A fork has
its own.

| Name | Kind | Default | Values | What it does | Set by |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------------|:-------|
| `LAUNCHER_AUTO_RELEASE` | Repository variable (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Variables), read by `ci.yml` | unset: on | `false` pauses automatic releases; unset, they are on | Automatic launcher releases: a push to `dauntless-revived` that passes every check, is still the head of the branch, and has a launcher version with no `launcher-v<version>` release yet publishes that launcher ([Launcher releases]({{ dev_page.url | relative_url }}#launcher-releases)). Only the repository `mixutin/dauntless-revived` publishes automatically. While it is `false`, Actions > **Launcher release** > **Run workflow** still publishes by hand. | The repository owner |

The workflows need no secrets of their own: they use the token GitHub gives every run, with write
access only in the jobs that publish a release. Code scanning with CodeQL is the repository's default
setup, a repository setting, not a workflow file. GitHub's immutable releases setting must stay off,
because the `launcher-updates` release that installed launchers read is updated in place.

## Test-only variables {#test-only}

Only the automated tests read these. How to run the tests is in the
[Developer guide]({{ dev_page.url | relative_url }}).

| Name | Component | Default | What it does |
|:-----|:----------|:--------|:-------------|
| `TEST_LOG_LEVEL` | metagame and deploy server tests | `silent` | Log level during `npm test` (copied into `LOG_LEVEL`). The tests set their own `NODE_ENV`, database and ports and never read your `.env`. |
| `CONTENT_IT_GAME_DIR` | content server integration test | `C:\D144\Dauntless` | The real 1.4.4 install to serve; the test is skipped when it is missing. |
| `CONTENT_IT_PORT`, `CONTENT_IT_MOCK_PORT` | content server integration test | `62002`, `62003` | Ports of the server under test and of the mock metagame. 62002 is also the kit sandbox's content port, so do not run both at once. |

---

## Names that are not settings {#not-settings}

- `GAMESERVER_LAUNCHER` appears on the roadmap as an idea for starting game servers through Wine. No
  code reads it.
- A list in the metagame's `BIND_HOST` (`127.0.0.1,<Tailscale address>`) is planned. Today it takes
  one address.
- `GATEWAY_CHAT_URL`, `GATEWAY_ACCESS_LOG`, `ALLOWLIST_RULE_NAME`, `ALLOWLIST_UDP_PORTS` and
  `ALLOWLIST_PROGRAM` are names from early drafts of the server kit. Nothing reads them, and the
  installer deletes them.
