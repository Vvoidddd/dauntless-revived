// Friends' online status (CHAT_PRESENCE=1, with CHAT=1; docs/findings/chat.md). Harmonic's fork
// (github.com/Harmonicrain/Undaunted 895f7c7) had the idea of a presence service; this is written for our
// chat server and shares no code with that one. The 1.4.4 client never asks for a roster, never subscribes and
// never probes: it only knows what the server pushes (C:\dr\data\plans\chat\presence-friends.md, B), so:
//
// - A player's own broadcast presence (no "to") is relayed to every session of each ACCEPTED friend the
//   player has not blocked and is not blocked by, once that session has sent a presence of its own: <show>
//   and the <status> JSON exactly as the client sent them, from the player's FULL JID (the presence module
//   drops a sender without a resource, B 0x143a382b0). Every later change is relayed the same way.
// - At a session's first broadcast it gets the current presence of each friend who is online in that sense.
// - When a session ends (its <close/>, a ping timeout, a dropped socket, replacement) or broadcasts
//   type="unavailable", its friends get type="unavailable" from its full JID; if the account still has
//   another session with a presence, that presence follows, so the friend does not show as offline.
// - An accepted friend request (HTTP) pushes the client's friends-list message from xmpp-admin@<domain>
//   (FOnlineFriendsMcp::OnXmppMessageReceived 0x1408ba550 accepts only that sender) to both players, then
//   exchanges their presences; an unfriend or a block sends each the other's unavailable.
//
// The one rule that must never break: no stanza outside a room ever reaches a player from the player's own
// account, not even from a second session of it. The party's automatic kick of "offline" members only runs
// while the local player's own Phoenix presence is online (B 0x1415f7562), and the client's own presence
// arriving from the server is what could set it. Deliver() refuses such a stanza, and the chat tests check
// every stanza the server sends.
//
// A client that changes its presence too often has the changes held back (PRESENCE_BURST, then one per
// PRESENCE_REFILL_MS), and the latest state goes out at the next tick. That covers every change a session
// makes while it stays connected: its first presence, an unavailable broadcast and coming back after one
// too, so going offline and online in a loop cannot get past the limit. Only the end of a session is sent
// at once (it gets no more ticks). The friends lookup and the block checks run only when something is
// sent, and the block check only for friends who are online.
